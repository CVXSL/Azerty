# Azerty Documentation
Azerty Development is a development group for game information discord bots. This repository holds all documentation and bot code for all of our bots.

## Azerty Utilities
Azerty Utilities is our first official discord bot that is meant for utility and some moderator commands. This bot is mostly used to manage our [discord server](https://discord.gg/FQ3WeJgCTN), but we decided to make it public so people can use some of our tools.

#### Invite Bot *(coming soon!)*

## Azerty MC
Azerty MC is our second official discord bot that is meant for the Minecraft Bedrock, Java and Legacy versions of the game!

#### Invite Bot *(coming soon!)*
