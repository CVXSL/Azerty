## Custom Skin Support

### ðŸ‘• Custom Geometry Skins

On March 30th 2020, Microsoft introduced new technical and policy changes to (custom) skins in Minecraft multiplayer. This affects players that use skins with custom geometry, sometimes called "4D Skins" in the community.

Marketplace Skins, Hive Costumes and regular Alex/Steve retextures are **NOT** affected by these changes. We continue to apply Hive-side filters to all skins - this _may_ block some extra small or big skins that are allowed on different servers.

Players that attempt to use custom geometry will appear as Steve with a yellow shirt other players.

These changes do not affect capes.

This is Microsoft policy and **not** up for debate with Hive staff.

### ðŸŽ½ Persona (Character Creator) Skins

As of January 2021, Persona (Character Creator) skins are disabled on The Hive. These changes were made to improve performance and reduce lag for our players.

Players that join The Hive wearing a Persona skin will appear as Steve with a yellow shirt other players.

We hope to re-enable Persona skins in the future, once the performance issues on Minecraft's side have been resolved.
