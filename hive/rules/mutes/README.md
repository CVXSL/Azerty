## Why am I muted / why can nobody see what I type?

here are two types of mutes on The Hive server:

- Server mutes, issued by The Hive. If you've been muted by Hive staff, you will get a message in chat informing you about your punishment.
- Communication Suspensions, issued by Mojang (Microsoft). If you've been suspended, your message will go through, but other players will NOT see it.

### Server Mutes

These mutes are issued by Hive staff. Each mute has a reason and expiry date, which are shown to you in chat. Appeals may be sent to support@playhive.com by email, but do keep in mind we will **not** undo correct punishments.

If you do not see a reason for your mute in chat but nobody is seeing your messages, this is most likely a Communication Suspension. Hive-issued punishments will always show a reason and expiry date.

### Communication Suspensions

All Featured Servers and Minecraft Realms make use of Mojang's chat filter. This filter automatically detects negative words or phrases and removes them from view. Communication Suspensions can also be issued automatically by Mojang's filter, or in rare cases, given manually by Mojang staff.

Please note that **The Hive has no control over this filter or Communication Suspensions**, therefore we sadly cannot assist with this issue. For more information, please see the Frequently Asked Questions below.

### Communication Suspensions: Frequently Asked Questions

**ü§î What is a Communication Suspension?**
When you are suspended, your messages will appear to be sent but no one else will see them. If you find that other players are not responding to you, consider that they may not be able to see your messages.

**üòï Why am I suspended?**
Most automated suspensions are due to extreme language, and (over)sharing private information. Remember, Mojang's filter operates across all Featured Servers and Realms, so you may have been suspended for something you did not say on the Hive.

**‚åö How long will my suspension last?**
The vast majority of these suspensions are temporary, and will be automatically removed when your chat behavior improves. However, certain trigger words (extreme racism, for example) will permanently suspend you. Repeat offenders may also receive longer or permanent suspensions.

**ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è How do I get rid of my suspension?**
The most effective way to do this is by improving your chat behavior. Making sure your behavior is more in-line with unpunished users will often help lift your suspension. Please note that this is not a guaranteed solution, especially if you have been permanently suspended.

**üêù Can The Hive help me?**
The Hive is not responsible for running the chat filter, and as such cannot make any exceptions or lift any suspensions. Hive Support is **NOT** able to assist you with these suspensions, as we have no control over them or Mojang's filter. Xbox support will **NOT** unsuspend you.

**üôä Why can I talk on another server, but not The Hive?**
This does **not** mean you are not suspended. Your chat reputation is bound to your Xbox account and follows you between Featured Servers and Realms. If you are playing on a private server, or a server that is **not** featured, your suspension will not be active.

### Warning About 'Unsuspension' Methods

A popular theory within the community is that spamming certain things, such as the alphabet, or flooding the chat with certain phrases, will lead to unsuspension. This is **not** true, and will likely make your suspension worse.

Flooding, spamming and other 'techniques' might have worked in the past, but the filter has been modified to block this behavior. Using any of these 'solutions' will lead to your reputation **worsening**, not improving. You also risk receiving a manual Hive mute, as this behavior violates our rules as well.
